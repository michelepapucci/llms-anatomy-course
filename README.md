# LLMs Anatomy Course
Repository for the LLMs Anatomy Course held by [Alessio Miaschi](https://alemiaschi.github.io/) for the theoretical part, and [Michele Papucci](https://michelepapucci.github.io/) for the laboratories. 

## Course Structure 

The course is divided in 6 lessons, most of them will have a theoric introduction and a hands-on laboratory:
- Lecture 1: Introduction to NLP and to Language Models;
- Lecture 2: Introduction to Transformers + Laboratory;
- Lecture 3: Transformer Pipeline + Laboratory;
- Lecture 4: Generative Models and their uses + Laboratory;
- Lecture 5: Interpretability and Analysis of Transformers + Laboratory; 
- Lecture 6: Interpretability and Explainability for Transformers + Laboratory;

## Repository Structure

Inside `slides/` you'll find the slides for the theoretical part, inside `code/` you'll find all the notebooks and Python script that will be used for the laboratory, with the necessary data if needed.

All the notebooks will also be hosted on Google colab for easy access. Here the list of the Colab Notebooks for each Laboratory:
